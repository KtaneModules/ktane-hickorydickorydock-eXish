                <p class="fancy">Hickory dickory dock,<br>this module contains a clock.<br>Now don’t get cross,<br>for it’s a boss,<br>but other than that a cakewalk.</p>
                <p class="fancy">As the bomb’s timer slowly doth churn,<br>sometimes both the clock hands will turn.<br>The big one will guide<br>your eyes to its side:<br>a module that you now concern.</p>
                <p class="fancy">If that one’s been used before,<br>go down that path one space more.<br>But if it’s alone,<br>the module is prone,<br>to become a menial chore.</p>
                <p class="fancy">The small hand may-</p>
                <p>That’s quite enough out of you, Wickerbottom. I’ll handle this.</p>
                <p class="fancy">But how will the expert know how to solve this module?</p>
                <p>An old-fashioned proper manual. There’s other modules poems work better for. Maybe try something sudoku related?</p>
                <p class="fancy">...Fine.</p>

                <p>My apologies. My name is Mouse, and I’m the very same mouse that kept running up a grandfather clock. I was simply trying to visit my lovely girlfriend who lives at the top, but the passing sands of time kept thwarting my plans... and now my struggle is a nursery rhyme for children across the world to take pleasure in. But enough about that- that damned clock has found its way onto your bomb.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the progression of the bomb, occasionally the clock will chime and both hands will move to a new position. This can only happen at most 12 times per bomb.</li>
                    <li>The minutes hand will point in one of eight principal directions, at another module. Take the name of this module. If a module that has been used in a previous activation is pointed at, use the next module in that direction.</li>
                    <li>The hours hand will point at one of the 12 directions of a clock face. Take the number it points to, and index into the name of the module with that number, looping around if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Take the alphabetic position of the letter or numeric value of the digit you land on, and modulo it by 4. If a character that’s landed on is neither a letter nor a digit, use 0.</li>
                    <li>For each time the hands move, the clock will strike a unique number from one to twelve- for example, if the clock strikes three, the bell inside will ring three times.</li>
                    <li>Once every <a href="../More/Ignore Table.html#mod=hickoryDickoryDockModule">non-ignored module</a> has been solved, the module will enter submission mode. The hands will disappear, and the numbers on the face will sink into the module and be replaced with orbs. The color of these orbs can be changed by pressing them.</li>
                    <li>Sort the calculated values from each activation by the number struck by the clock at the time. Convert each value to a color using the table below, set each orb in order of the numbers they replaced to the corresponding color, then press the pedestal the hands were attached to.</li>
                    <li>If everything is done correctly, the module will solve. If an incorrect submission is made, the module will cycle through its previous activations one at a time until the pedestal is pressed again, which will activate submission mode again.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Upon solving the module, I shall be reunited with my lovely partner, and we can share a nice piece of cheese in peace- a scene that our old friend Quaranius Lindenburg Wickerbottom has decided to illustrate.</p>

                    <li>In the event that this module is the only module on its face of the bomb, or the module generates in an otherwise unsolvable way, the orbs will already be present and all be colored green. Simply press the pedestal to instantly solve the module.</li>
                    <li>If less than 12 stages are generated, the color of the orbs corresponding to a number that hasn’t been struck can be any color and will not be considered during the submission.</li>
